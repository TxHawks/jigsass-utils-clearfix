section: u-cf (clearfix)
---
Force an element to clear its floated child element and
prevent its layout from collapsing.

#### Installation

Using npm:

```sh
npm i -S jigsass-utils-clearfix
```

#### Usage
Import JigSass Utils Clearfix into your main scss file near its very end, together with all
other utilities (utilities should always be the last to be imported).

```scss
@import 'path/to/jigsass-utils-clearfix/scss/index';
```

Importing the file will create any styles by itself. You would need to indicate that the
`.u-cf` class should actually be generated in each component or object it is used in:

```scss
// _c.foo.scss
.foo {
  @include jigsass-util(u-cf);

  ...
}
```

```scss
// _c.bar.scss
.bar {
  @include jigsass-util(u-clearfix);

  ...
}
```

```scss
// _c.baz.scss
.baz {
  @include jigsass-util(u-clearfix);

  ...
}
```

Doing so helps us a great deal with portability, as no matter where we import component or object
partials, the correct utility classes will be generated. Think of it as a poor man's dependency
management.

Developer communication is also assisted by including "dependencies" wherever they are required,
as anyone going through a partial, can easily understand how it should be marked up with just a
glance.

As far as bloat goes, just don't worry about it - the actual styles will only be generated once,
at the location in the cascade where the Jigsass Clearfix partial was imported into the main file:

```scss
// output.css
.u-cf:after {
  clear: both;
  content: '';
  display: block;
}
```

```example:html
<div class='u-cf' style='background-color: #09a5d9;'>
  <div class="fpo">Cleared float</div>
</div>
```
*/
@include jigsass-define-util(u-cf) {
  &:after {
    clear: both;
    content: '';
    display: block;
  }
}
